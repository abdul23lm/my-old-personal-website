# Abdul Latif Munjiat Personal Website

Hey! Iam Abdul Latif Munjiat. How nice of you to look at my personal site, Thank you!

This is written in Typescript using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), as a SSG tool. It utilizes [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as well as  [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animations.

## Local Development

This is just a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Please use atleast Node v12, but the recommended version is Node v14 LTS. There's a `.nvmrc`, you can run `nvm use` if you have nvm installed.

## Getting Started

This project heavily favors <b>yarn</b> over npm. 

So to set things up you need to run

```bash
yarn install
```
or just
```bash
yarn
```

Then to run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

and it should open at

> http://localhost:3000/


## Deployment

Nothing special, its setup at Netlify end (in other words: no `netlify.toml`), just merge a feat branch to master branch and you're good.
